# 🔬 Can MCS identify archaeological materials?
#
# The Comechingón peoples of the Sierras de Córdoba shaped
# quartz, calcite, and iron-oxide pigments into tools and
# morteros. If we can distinguish these minerals using
# particle beams, we gain a non-destructive tool for
# archaeology — no sample damage required.
